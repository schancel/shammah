# Changelog

All notable changes to Shammah will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.2.0] - 2026-02-16

### Added
- **Setup wizard improvements**: Pre-fills existing Claude API key with visual feedback
  - Shows truncated view for long keys (first 40 + last 10 chars)
  - Green text indicates pre-filled values
  - Clear instructions: "(Pre-filled - press Backspace to clear)"
  - Cursor indicator for better UX
- **GitHub Actions CI/CD**: Automated testing and releases
  - CI workflow runs on every push (formatting, clippy, builds)
  - Release workflow auto-builds binaries for all platforms on version tags
  - Multi-platform support: Linux x86_64, macOS x86_64, macOS ARM64
- **Config migration**: Automatic handling of deprecated execution targets
  - Gracefully filters out deprecated "metal" variant
  - Falls back to platform defaults if needed
  - Logs warnings for unknown targets

### Fixed
- **Setup wizard bug**: Config failed to load when `fallback_chain` contained deprecated "metal" variant
  - Root cause: Deserialization error caused wizard to start with empty values
  - Solution: Custom deserializer filters invalid entries
- **Debug logging loop**: Removed infinite `eprintln!` statements in shadow buffer
  - Previously caused binary to hang on `--version` command
  - Now runs cleanly without debug spam

### Changed
- **README improvements**: Made installation clearer and more compelling
  - Added "Why Shammah?" section up front
  - One-liner download commands for all platforms
  - Clearer quick start (30 seconds to working AI)
  - Better formatting with badges and navigation
  - Comparison tables vs alternatives

### Infrastructure
- GitHub Actions workflows for CI and releases
- Automated binary builds on tag push
- Multi-platform release artifacts

## [0.1.0] - 2026-02-10

  - HTTP daemon mode with OpenAI-compatible API

- **Model Support**:
  - ONNX Runtime integration with CoreML/Metal acceleration
  - KV cache for efficient autoregressive generation
  - Adaptive model selection based on system RAM (1.5B/3B/7B/14B)
  - Multiple model families (Qwen, Llama, Mistral, Phi, DeepSeek)

- **Tool System**:
  - Interactive tool confirmation dialogs
  - Session and persistent approval patterns
  - Pattern-based matching (wildcards and regex)
  - Tool pass-through in daemon mode

- **TUI/UX**:
  - Professional terminal UI with scrollback
  - Multi-line input with Shift+Enter
  - Command history (1000 commands, persistent)
  - Live status bar with tokens/latency/speed
  - Query cancellation with Ctrl+C
  - Feedback system (Ctrl+G good, Ctrl+B bad)

  - Adaptive routing (local first, graceful fallback)
  - Setup wizard for configuration

- **Training System**:
  - Weighted example collection (10x/3x/1x)
  - JSONL export for training queue
  - Python training script (PyTorch + PEFT)
  - Non-blocking background training

### Infrastructure
