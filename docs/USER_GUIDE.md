## What is Shammah?

Shammah is a **local-first AI coding assistant** that combines the power of:
- **Pre-trained local models** (Qwen via ONNX Runtime) - works offline, preserves privacy
- **Teacher APIs** (Claude, GPT-4, Gemini, Grok) - high-quality fallback when needed
- **Tool execution** - can read files, run commands, search code
- **Continuous learning** - adapts to your coding style via LoRA fine-tuning

### Key Benefits

✅ **Works offline** - Local model runs on your machine
✅ **Privacy-first** - Code stays on your device
✅ **Instant startup** - <100ms to REPL (progressive loading)
✅ **Adaptive** - Learns from your feedback
✅ **Multi-provider** - Configure multiple teacher APIs
✅ **Tool-enabled** - Can execute commands with your approval

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# Start interactive session
shammah

# Ask a question
> How do I use lifetimes in Rust?

# Let it use tools (with your approval)
> Can you read my Cargo.toml and suggest improvements?
```

That's it! Shammah will guide you through setup on first run.

---

## Installation

### From Source

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/schancel/shammah.git

---

## First-Time Setup

When you run `shammah` for the first time, the setup wizard will guide you through:

### 1. Welcome Screen

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Welcome to Shammah Setup                    │
│                                             │
│ This wizard will help you configure:       │
│  • Teacher API (Claude/GPT-4/Gemini/Grok)  │
│  • Local model (optional, offline mode)    │
│  • Tool permissions                         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 2. Teacher API Configuration

**Recommended:** Start with Claude API for best results.

```
Teacher API Key:
> sk-ant-...

Which teachers would you like to configure?
  [x] Claude (Anthropic)  ← Selected
  [ ] GPT-4 (OpenAI)
  [ ] Gemini (Google)
  [ ] Grok (xAI)

Press 'a' to add more providers later.
```

You can add multiple providers and Shammah will use them as fallbacks.

### 3. Local Model Setup (Optional)

```
Would you like to enable local model?
  [x] Yes - Download model for offline use
  [ ] No - Use teacher APIs only

Model size (based on your RAM):
  [ ] Small (1.5B) - 8GB RAM
  [x] Medium (3B) - 16GB RAM  ← Recommended for 16GB systems
  [ ] Large (7B) - 32GB RAM
  [ ] XLarge (14B) - 64GB+ RAM
```

**First run:** Model downloads in background (5-30 minutes depending on size).
**Subsequent runs:** Instant startup, model loads from cache.

### 4. Completion

Setup is saved to `~/.shammah/config.toml`. You can edit it manually or re-run setup:

```bash
shammah setup
```

---

## Basic Usage

### Interactive REPL

```bash
shammah
```

This starts an interactive session. You can:
- Ask coding questions
- Request code reviews
- Get explanations
- Debug issues

**Example:**

```
❯ What's the difference between String and &str in Rust?

String is an owned, heap-allocated string that can grow and shrink.
&str is a borrowed string slice, typically a view into a String or
string literal. Use &str for function parameters when you don't need
ownership, and String when you need to own or modify the data.

Would you like to see examples?
```

### Single Query Mode

```bash
shammah query "Explain async/await in Rust"
```

Runs a single query and exits - useful for scripts.

### Keyboard Shortcuts

- **Enter:** Submit query
- **Shift+Enter:** New line (multi-line input)
- **Ctrl+C:** Cancel in-progress query
- **Ctrl+G:** Mark response as good (for training)
- **Ctrl+B:** Mark response as bad (for training)
- **Up/Down:** Navigate command history
- **Esc:** (In dialogs) Cancel

---

## Tool Confirmations

When Shammah needs to execute tools (read files, run commands), it will ask for your approval:

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Tool 'bash' requires approval            │
│                                          │
│ Input:                                   │
│ {                                        │
│   "command": "cargo test"                │
│ }                                        │
│                                          │
│ 1. Allow Once                            │
│ 2. Allow Exact (Session)                 │
│ 3. Allow Pattern (Session)               │
│ 4. Allow Exact (Persistent)              │
│ 5. Allow Pattern (Persistent)            │
│ 6. Deny                                  │
│                                          │
│ ↑/↓: Navigate  Enter: Confirm  Esc: Deny│
└──────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Approval Options

1. **Allow Once** - Execute this time only
2. **Allow Exact (Session)** - Allow this exact command until restart
3. **Allow Pattern (Session)** - Allow similar commands until restart
4. **Allow Exact (Persistent)** - Always allow this exact command
5. **Allow Pattern (Persistent)** - Always allow similar commands
6. **Deny** - Don't execute

**Patterns** let you approve categories of commands:
- `cargo test` in any directory
- Any `git` command in `/home/user/projects`
- Reading any file in `/home/user/safe-dir`

### Structured Patterns

You can create patterns that match command components separately:

```
cmd:"cargo test"  args:"*"  dir:"/home/*/projects"
```

This allows:
- `cargo test` in any user's projects directory
- Any arguments (e.g., `--release`, `--bin foo`)

Managed via `shammah tools` command.

## Advanced Features

### Command History

Press **Up/Down** arrows to navigate through previous queries.

History is saved to `~/.shammah/history.txt` (last 1000 commands).

### Feedback System

Help Shammah learn from your preferences:

- **Ctrl+G** - Good response (saves as training example)
- **Ctrl+B** - Bad response (saves as high-priority training data)

Feedback is weighted:
- Good: 1x weight
- Bad: 10x weight (learns faster from mistakes)

Data saved to `~/.shammah/feedback.jsonl` for LoRA training.

### Status Bar

The status bar shows:
```
Model: qwen-3b | Tokens: 234→156 | Latency: 1.2s | Speed: 130 tok/s | Memory: 4.2GB / 16GB
```

- **Model:** Current model being used
- **Tokens:** Input→Output token counts
- **Latency:** Response time
- **Speed:** Tokens per second
- **Memory:** Process/System RAM usage

### Multi-Provider Setup

Add additional teacher providers after initial setup:

```bash
shammah setup
# Navigate to teacher configuration
# Press 'a' to add a new provider
```

Providers are tried in order, with automatic fallback on errors.

---

## Daemon Mode

For advanced users and integrations.

### Auto-Spawning Daemon

The daemon starts automatically when you use `shammah`. It:
- Runs in background
- Serves OpenAI-compatible HTTP API
- Manages sessions and model loading
- Handles tool execution pass-through

### Manual Daemon Management

```bash
# Check daemon status
shammah daemon-status

# Stop daemon
shammah daemon-stop

# Start daemon manually
shammah daemon-start
```

### HTTP API

The daemon serves an OpenAI-compatible API on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`:

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/messages \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "qwen-3b",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]
  }'
```

Use this to integrate Shammah with other tools (VSCode extensions, etc.).

---

## Configuration

Config file: `~/.shammah/config.toml`

### Example Configuration

```toml
# Teacher API configuration
[teachers]
[[teachers.list]]
provider = "claude"
api_key = "sk-ant-..."
model = "claude-sonnet-4-5"

[[teachers.list]]
provider = "openai"
api_key = "sk-..."
model = "gpt-4"

# Local model configuration
[backend]
model_family = "Qwen"
model_size = "Medium"
execution_provider = "CoreML"  # or "CPU"

# Daemon configuration
[daemon]
bind_address = "127.0.0.1:8000"
auto_spawn = true

# LoRA training configuration
[lora]
rank = 16
alpha = 32.0
auto_train = true
auto_train_threshold = 10
high_weight = 10.0
medium_weight = 3.0
normal_weight = 1.0

# Tool permissions
[tools]
default_rule = "ask"  # "allow", "ask", or "deny"

```

### Storage Locations

- **Config:** `~/.shammah/config.toml`
- **Models:** `~/.cache/huggingface/hub/`
- **Adapters:** `~/.shammah/adapters/`
- **Feedback:** `~/.shammah/feedback.jsonl`
- **History:** `~/.shammah/history.txt`
- **Tool Patterns:** `~/.shammah/tool_patterns.json`
- **Daemon PID:** `~/.shammah/daemon.pid`

---

## Troubleshooting

### Model Download Issues

**Problem:** Model download stuck or slow

```bash
# Check HuggingFace Hub cache
ls ~/.cache/huggingface/hub/

# Re-download model
rm -rf ~/.cache/huggingface/hub/models--*Qwen*
shammah  # Will re-download on startup
```

**Problem:** Not enough disk space

Local models require:
- 1.5B: ~3GB
- 3B: ~6GB
- 7B: ~14GB
- 14B: ~28GB

Free up space or use teacher-only mode (no local model).

### Daemon Issues

**Problem:** Daemon won't start

```bash
# Check if port is in use
lsof -i :8000

# Force stop any existing daemon
shammah daemon-stop
rm ~/.shammah/daemon.pid

# Start fresh
shammah
```

**Problem:** Connection refused errors

```bash
# Check daemon status
shammah daemon-status

# Restart daemon
shammah daemon-stop
shammah daemon-start
```

### Memory Issues

**Problem:** System running out of RAM

1. Use a smaller model size in config
2. Close other memory-intensive applications
3. Check memory usage: `shammah memory`
4. Consider teacher-only mode (no local model)

### Performance Issues

**Problem:** Slow responses

- **Local model:** Normal on first query (model loading), faster on subsequent queries
- **Teacher API:** Check network connection
- **Check status bar** for actual response times

**Problem:** High CPU usage

This is normal during:
- Model loading (first query)
- Model inference (generating responses)
- LoRA training (background, after feedback)

### Tool Execution Issues

**Problem:** Tools not executing

1. Check tool permissions in config
2. Ensure you're approving tools when prompted
3. Check `~/.shammah/tool_patterns.json` for conflicting patterns

**Problem:** Confirmation dialogs not showing

Make sure terminal height is at least 15 lines:
```bash
# Check terminal size
echo $LINES $COLUMNS

# Resize terminal if needed
```

### Getting Help

```bash
# Show help
shammah --help

# Show tool status
shammah tools

# Show memory usage
shammah memory

# View logs
tail -f ~/.shammah/logs/shammah.log  # if enabled
```

## Tips & Best Practices

### 1. Start with Teacher APIs

Use Claude or GPT-4 first while local model downloads. You'll get high-quality responses immediately.

### 2. Approve Tool Patterns

Instead of approving every `cargo test` individually, approve the pattern once:
```
cmd:"cargo test" args:"*" dir:"/home/user/*"
```

### 3. Use Feedback Wisely

- **Ctrl+G (Good):** When response is exactly what you wanted
- **Ctrl+B (Bad):** When response has wrong approach or strategy

This helps LoRA training adapt to your preferences.

### 4. Multi-Provider Fallback

Configure multiple providers for resilience:
1. Claude (primary)
2. GPT-4 (fallback)
3. Gemini (backup)

If one is down or rate-limited, Shammah automatically tries the next.

### 5. Monitor Memory

Keep an eye on the status bar. If memory usage is high:
- Consider smaller model
- Close other applications
- Restart daemon to free memory

### 6. Keyboard Shortcuts

Learn the shortcuts:
- **Shift+Enter** for multi-line input
- **Up/Down** for history
- **Ctrl+C** to cancel long queries
- **Ctrl+G/B** for feedback

### 7. Review Tool Patterns

Periodically review your approved patterns:
```bash
shammah tools
```

Remove overly permissive patterns for security.
