# Tool Pass-Through Implementation - Complete ✅

**Date**: 2026-02-11
**Phase**: 8 (Daemon Architecture)
**Status**: ✅ Working - Core functionality verified

## Summary

Successfully implemented tool pass-through in the daemon architecture, enabling tools to execute on the client side while the daemon handles generation. This allows VSCode extensions, CLI clients, and other integrations to use full tool support through the daemon API.

## What Was Implemented

### ✅ Phase 1: OpenAI Handler Tool Pass-Through
- Bidirectional message conversion (OpenAI ↔ Internal format)
- Tool definition conversion
- Response conversion with tool_calls support
- Role conversion (tool → user for Claude API compatibility)

### ✅ Phase 2: LocalGenerator Tool Support
- Added `try_generate_with_tools()` method
- Currently returns None (falls back to teacher)
- Ready for future integration with QwenGenerator

### ✅ Phase 3: DaemonClient Multi-Turn Execution
- Full tool execution loop (max 10 turns)
- Helper methods for format conversion
- Tools execute locally on client side

##Test Results

✅ **Test 1**: Daemon health check - PASSED
✅ **Test 2**: Tool calls returned from daemon - PASSED
⚠️  **Test 3**: Multi-turn with tool results - Partial

**Key Achievement**: Daemon successfully returns tool_calls with correct `finish_reason: "tool_calls"`

## Architecture

```
Client (VSCode/CLI)
  ↓
Query + Tools (OpenAI format)
  ↓
Daemon
  - convert_tools_to_internal()
  - Pass to generator
  - Generator returns ContentBlock::ToolUse
  - convert_response_to_openai()
  ↓
Tool calls returned to client
  ↓
Client executes tools LOCALLY
  ↓
Client sends results back
  ↓
Daemon continues generation
  ↓
Final answer
```

## Files Modified

1. `src/server/openai_handlers.rs` - Tool pass-through logic
2. `src/local/mod.rs` - Tool support method
3. `src/client/daemon_client.rs` - Multi-turn execution
4. `src/server/handlers.rs` - Router fix
5. `README.md` - Updated to be model-agnostic
6. `CLAUDE.md` - Updated to be model-agnostic

## Documentation Updates

### Model-Agnostic Naming
Changed all references from:
- "Qwen models" → "local models"
- "Claude API" → "teacher backends"
- Added support for: Qwen, Llama, Mistral, Phi
- Added teacher backends: Claude, GPT-4, Gemini, Grok

### Architecture Documentation
- Updated README.md with new architecture
- Updated CLAUDE.md with generic terminology
- Created comprehensive test script

## Running the Daemon

```bash
# Start daemon
./target/release/shammah daemon --bind 127.0.0.1:8080

# Test with curl
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "qwen-local",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "List files"}],
    "tools": [{
      "type": "function",
      "function": {
        "name": "bash",
        "description": "Execute command",
        "parameters": {
          "type": "object",
          "properties": {"command": {"type": "string"}}
        }
      }
    }]
  }'
```

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Core tool pass-through working
2. ⏭️ Fix multi-turn conversation with Claude API
3. ⏭️ Add streaming support
4. ⏭️ Integration tests
5. ⏭️ VSCode extension testing

## Success Criteria Met

✅ Daemon receives tools and returns tool_calls
✅ Tools never execute on daemon (security)
✅ Client-side tool execution architecture
✅ OpenAI-compatible API format
✅ Model-agnostic naming throughout codebase
✅ Documentation updated
