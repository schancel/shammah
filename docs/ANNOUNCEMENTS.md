**Title:** Show HN: Shammah – Local-first AI coding assistant that learns your style

**Post:**

```
I built Shammah, a local-first AI coding assistant that actually works offline.

Unlike cloud AI assistants, Shammah:
- Runs entirely on your machine (privacy-first)
- Works offline after initial setup
- Learns your coding patterns through weighted LoRA fine-tuning
- Costs $0 per query after setup
- Starts instantly (<100ms)

The key innovation is weighted feedback: you can mark critical mistakes with 10x weight so the model learns to avoid anti-patterns strongly, while good examples get normal weight.

It uses pre-trained models (Qwen/Llama/Mistral via ONNX) so it works well from day 1, then adapts to your specific needs over time. No months of training data collection required.

Also includes full tool execution (read files, run tests, search codebase) and runs as an OpenAI-compatible API server for multi-client use.

One-liner install:
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/schancel/shammah/main/install.sh | bash

GitHub: https://github.com/schancel/shammah
Release: https://github.com/schancel/shammah/releases/tag/v0.2.0

Built in Rust, works on macOS (Intel + Apple Silicon) and Linux.

Would love feedback from the HN community!

🚀 Launching Shammah v0.2.0 - A local-first AI coding assistant that actually works offline

Unlike cloud AI:
✅ Runs on YOUR machine
✅ Works offline after setup
✅ Learns YOUR coding style
✅ $0 per query
✅ Privacy-first

🧵 1/5

The secret sauce: Weighted LoRA fine-tuning

Mark critical mistakes with 10x weight → model strongly learns to avoid them
Mark good examples with 1x weight → model remembers patterns

Your AI assistant that actually learns from YOUR feedback.

## Reddit - /r/LocalLLaMA

**Title:** [Release] Shammah v0.2.0 - Local-first AI coding assistant with weighted LoRA fine-tuning

**Post:**

```markdown
Hey r/LocalLLaMA!

I just released Shammah v0.2.0 - a local-first AI coding assistant that I think you'll find interesting.

## What is it?

Shammah runs pre-trained models (Qwen, Llama, Mistral, Phi) locally via ONNX Runtime, then continuously improves through weighted LoRA fine-tuning based on your feedback.

## Why it's different

**Weighted feedback system:**
- 🔴 High-weight (10x): "Never use .unwrap() in production" → model strongly avoids this
- 🟡 Medium-weight (3x): "Prefer iterator chains over loops" → model learns your style
- 🟢 Normal-weight (1x): "This is good, remember this" → reinforces patterns

This means you can prioritize critical feedback and the model actually learns YOUR anti-patterns, not just generic ones.

## Key Features

- **Instant startup**: REPL ready in <100ms, model loads in background
- **Adaptive sizing**: Auto-selects model based on RAM (1.5B/3B/7B/14B)
- **Hardware acceleration**: Metal (Apple Silicon), CUDA, or CPU
- **Full tool execution**: Read files, run commands, search codebase
- **OpenAI-compatible API**: Run as daemon, drop-in replacement
- **Privacy-first**: Everything runs locally, code never leaves your machine

## Installation

One-liner:
```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/schancel/shammah/main/install.sh | bash
```

Or download binaries:
- [macOS ARM64](https://github.com/schancel/shammah/releases/latest/download/shammah-macos-aarch64.tar.gz)
- [macOS x86_64](https://github.com/schancel/shammah/releases/latest/download/shammah-macos-x86_64.tar.gz)
- [Linux x86_64](https://github.com/schancel/shammah/releases/latest/download/shammah-linux-x86_64.tar.gz)

## Quick Start

```bash
./shammah setup  # Interactive wizard
./shammah        # Start REPL

> How do I implement a binary search tree in Rust?
# Works immediately, model downloads in background
# Future queries use fast local model
```

## Tech Details

- Built in Rust
- ONNX Runtime with CoreML/Metal/CUDA execution providers
- KV cache for efficient generation
- LoRA adapters via PyTorch + PEFT
- HTTP daemon mode with session management

**Title:** [Project] Shammah - Local-first AI coding assistant built in Rust

**Post:**

```markdown
Hey Rustaceans!

I built Shammah, a local-first AI coding assistant in Rust that I wanted to share.

## Why Rust?

- **Memory safety**: Handles large models without leaks
- **Performance**: ONNX Runtime integration with zero-copy tensors
- **Async**: Tokio for daemon mode with concurrent sessions
- **Cross-platform**: Works on macOS, Linux, Windows
- **Apple Silicon**: Native Metal acceleration via CoreML

## Architecture

```

├── cli/             # TUI (Ratatui)
└── providers/       # Multi-provider support
```

**Key tech:**
- `ort` - ONNX Runtime bindings
- `hf-hub` - HuggingFace model downloads
- `tokio` - Async runtime
- `axum` - HTTP server
- `ratatui` - Terminal UI
- `serde` - Config + API serialization

## What it does
